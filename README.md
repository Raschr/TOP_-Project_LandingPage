# TOP_-Project_LandingPage 

This is the first landing-page i've made from scratch. It's made as a tribute to our beloved flex-box-dog (sorry, can't remember his/her name). 

It's taken me way to many hours and the result is only "ok". But it was a good learning experience. If anyone can use this for anything, please go ahead and steal everything you want.
